# global_ypr

This analysis is aimed at projecting the yield per recruit (and spawning biomass per recruit if data are available) of global fisheries under projected changes in life history. Currently, an example data set can be analyzed to produce YPR curves for different time periods in 'basic_example'. An implementation for two stocks from the Bering Sea can be seen in the folder 'Alaska'. Future steps can be found in the issue tracker.

The current analysis is age-based, but size-based methods (e.g. for crustaceans) may be developed in the future.
