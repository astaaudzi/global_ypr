# global_ypr

This analysis is aimed at projecting the yield per recruit (and spawning biomass per recruit if data are available) of global fisheries. Currently, an example data set can be analyzed to produce YPR curves for different time periods. Future steps can be found in the issue tracker.

The current analysis is age-based, but size-based methods may be developed in the future.
